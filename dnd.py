# The DC is a number representing how hard a task is
# When a player wants to do something uncertain, like jumping a gap or sneaking past guards, the Dungeon Master (DM) sets a DC. 
# The player rolls a 20-sided die (D20) and adds modifiers from their character to the roll. 
# If the total meets or beats the DC, the action succeeds. If not, it fails. 
# The D20 introduces randomness, making even skilled characters sometimes fail in challenging situations, adding excitement to the game.

# The program should take in a single integer value representing the DC then randomly roll a value from 1 to 20 inclusively. 
# Determine if the player was successful at succeeding the ability check.
